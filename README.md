# Simulation of Skyum's Protocol

A small simulation I put together to run a series of iterations of Skyum's Protocol. It was derived from the solution expressed in Veritasium's video on the subject with the outcome that closed loops are formed whenever an individual finds their box within another box. Please watch the video [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iSNsgj1OCLA) for more information. We can assume the program works well as the answer always tends towards 30%.

## Usage

Simply clone the repository using `git clone https://www.github.com/br34th3r/simulation-of-skyums-protocol.git` and then run the main file using `python3 main.py <ITERATIONS>` where you substitute <ITERATIONS> for the number of iterations you'd like to perform.
